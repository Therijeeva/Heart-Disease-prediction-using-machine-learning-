# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning.

Heart disease is one of the complex diseases and globally many people suffered from this disease. This project proposes an efficient and accurate machine learning-based system for diagnosing heart disease. We work on predicting possible Heart Diseases in people using Machine Learning algorithms. In this project we perform the comparative analysis of classifiers like K-nearest neighbour, C-support vector and Random Forest and we propose an ensemble classifier which perform classification by taking strong and weak classifiers since it can have multiple number of samples for training and validating the data so we perform the analysis of existing classifier and proposed classifier like K-nearest neighbour which can give the better accuracy and predictive analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieved good accuracy compared to previous methods, making it a promising tool for the identification of heart disease. The system has the potential to be easily implemented in healthcare for better patient outcomes. Further research could validate its performance on larger datasets and diverse populations.

Keywords: K-nearest neighbour; C-support vector; Random Forest; python programming; confusion matrix; correlation matrix.
